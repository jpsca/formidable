## Vision

For Internet standards, HTML forms are an ancient technology. At some point we even forgot it existed and, for about 10 years, everyone was super excited about sending JSON over everything, all of the time.

But now we are realizing *"Oh, do you know what? HTML is actually really good! Like, you can send it directly to a browser and the browser can send form data back, without any translation step... we should all do this"*.

However, in the world of Python web frameworks there is a problem: web forms had always been somewhat awkward. In fact, they were a big reason to use JavaScript in the first place. The existing libraries lack support for features like nested forms and/or are embedded in a particular framework.

That's why I built **Formidable**, a library that, although small, can handle all the advanced scenarios like subforms, dynamic nested forms, custom validators, translatable messages, integration with any ORM and template system, and more. I hope you enjoy it.
